## Overview
SmartFit AI leverages a dataset of user fitness metrics to provide actionable insights. Using techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction, K-Means clustering for profile segmentation, and neural networks for predictions, it helps users optimize their health journeys. The interactive Streamlit app visualizes data, predicts outcomes, and generates recommendations in real-time.

## Features
- **Predictions**: Real-time calorie burn, BMI, body fat analysis, and workout impact projections.
- **Clustering**- Unsupervised learning to group users into 5 fitness archetypes (Elite Athletes, Strength Builders, Enthusiasts, Beginners, Health Focus).
- **Recommendations**: AI-driven workout schedules and diet plans tailored to user stats, goals, and equipment.
- **Visualizations**: Radar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and more for intuitive data exploration.
- **Data Analysis**: Correlation heatmaps, PCA visualizations, and distribution analyses.

## Dashboard Sections

## Dataset
- **Shape**: (20,000, 62) â€“ 20,000 rows with 62 features.
- **Key Columns and Datatypes**:
  - `age`: float64
  - `gender`: object
  - `weight_kg`: float64
  - `height_m`: float64
  - `max_bpm`: float64
  - ... (additional features like `pct_fats`: float64, `difficulty_level_enc`: int32, `cluster`: int32, `pca1`: float64, `pca2`: float64)
- **Missing Values (%)**: 0.0 across all columns (e.g., `age`: 0.0, `protein_per_kg`: 0.0, `sets`: 0.0, `benefit`: 0.0, `sodium_mg`: 0.0, `cholesterol_mg`: 0.0, `serving_size_g`: 0.0,0.0).
- The dataset is fully clean with no missing values, making it ideal for direct modeling.

## Model Performance
- **Clustering**: K-Means applied on PCA-reduced features (`pca1`, `pca2`).
- **Classification Report** (on 4,000 test samples):
